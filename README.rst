PostgreSQL Performance Farm
===========================

This repository contains the code for the PostgreSQL Performance Farm.

web/
----

The web/ directory contains the Django application that forms the basis of the
website. In order to run the site, you will need to setup a Python virtualenv,
e.g::

  $ sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
  $ source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
  $ mkvirtualenv -p python2.7 pgperffarm

For ease of future use, configure virtualenvs from your .bash_profile::

  $ echo "source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh" >> ~/.bash_profile

To activate the environment in future sessions, run::

  $ workon pgperffarm

Then, install the required modules. Note that we use Django 1.8.11 as that's
what is currently supported on the postgresql.org infrastructure::

  $ PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/pgsql/bin pip install -r web/requirements.txt

Next, create a settings_local.py file::

  $ cp web/pgperffarm/settings_local.py.in web/pgperffarm/settings_local.py

Edit the file and change the database configuration and other settings to suit
your environment. Make sure you create the required database and user account
on your PostgreSQL server.

Finally, synchronise the database::

  $ cd web
  $ python manage.py makemigrations
  $ python manage.py migrate

That should be all. In case of an error (relation does not exist), run the makemigrations and migrate commands for the specific app:: 

    $ python manage.py makemigrations users
    $ python manage.py migrate users

To test, run the following command and point a browser at
the URL shown::

  $ python manage.py runserver

You should see the index page of the application.
